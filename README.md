Project goals:
To make an interactive, automated "Secret Santa" web app.

Functions:

Name distribution:

Each family member will get a randomized name for whom they will buy a Christmas gift.
    - Same core family members can not be selected
    - Name of Santa pairs to be saved in a .txt file

Santa guessing:

On Christmas evening the functionality will change where picking the user has to select who he hinks is their "secret santa"

Big Reveal:

Once all users have entered their guess, the page will display the secret santa links
